# social_activitypub
A Drupal module to link Open Social to ActivityPub

Currently this is a bare bones implementation. 
Under /admin/config/services/activitypub/activitypub-type a new plugin 
'Open Social Public message' that can be added to the 'note' or other 
custom activity pub types, and link these to the Open social post entity.
